When we learn something new, we are using our working memory. Our working memory is like a so-so blackboard with limited capacity to hold four [chunks](notes/kaizen/chunks.md). To move these chunks into long term memory, we need [deliberate-practice](notes/kaizen/deliberate-practice.md) using [recall](notes/kaizen/recall.md) method. Spaced repetition technique is to spread out our repeating practices over a number of days to build stronger neural structures.

Learning and relearning is the way to set it into longer-term memory storage.
