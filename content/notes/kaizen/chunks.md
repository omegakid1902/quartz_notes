## What is a chunk?
- Compact information where my brain can easily access.
- Network of neurons used to firing together so you can think a thought or perform an action smoothly and effectively.
- Pieces of information bound together by use and meaning

## What is chunking?
- mental leap to unite information through meaning
- new logical whole makes it easier to remember
- makes it easier to fit into the larger picture of what we're learning
- involve learning how to use a certain problem solving technique

## How to form chunks
1. Undivided focused attention
2. Understanding the basics
     - super glue to help hold the underlying memory traces together
3. [delibrate-practice](delibrate-practice) - gain mastery and gain bigger picture context

## Chunking is use to gain expertise
- create conceptual chunks that unite scattered bits of information through meaning
- add small chunks to larger chunks
- chunking is bottom up process where practice and [spaced-repetition](notes/kaizen/spaced-repetition.md) can help build and strengthen chunks
- using context, which is a top down big picture process allows me to see where what I am learning fits in
- both top down big picture and bottom up chunking processes are vital to [gain-mastery](notes/kaizen/gain-mastery.md) over material
- practice growing chunks and build a library of chunk patterns
- diffuse mode can help connect two or more chunks together

Note: Stress and emotions like anger and fear affects ability to make connections.
