## Interleaving Technique
- skipping around to review helps to learn more deeply
  - appears to be difficult at first but with more practice, the process becomes easier
- practice jumping back and forth between problems/solutions that require different techniques and strategies
- learn basics and then learn how to select and use different chunks
- builds flexibility and creativity
- think independently
- interleaving in one subject, develops creativity
- interviewing in multiple subjects, can more easily make interesting new connections between chunks/fields and enhance creativity further
