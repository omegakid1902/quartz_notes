title: "Delibrate Practice"
---

- Is purposeful  and systematic
- Requires focused attention on small steps towards improving performance
- Improvement requires our attention to identify our weakness and adjust accordingly
- Continuing to focus on the hardest material -> eat your frogs first
- Technique is important to productive studying
- Balance of different concepts
- Two standout quotes from James Clear of Atomic Habits[^jamesclear]:
  > “The greatest challenge of deliberate practice is to remain focused.
  > In the beginning, showing up and putting in your reps is the most
  > important thing. But after a while we begin to carelessly overlook
  > small errors and miss daily opportunities for improvement.”

  > “Deliberate practice always follows the same pattern:
  > break the overall process down into parts, identify your weaknesses,
  > test new strategies for each section, and then integrate 
  > your learning into the overall process.”
