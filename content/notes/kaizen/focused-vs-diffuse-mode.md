title: "Focused vs. Diffuse Modes"
--- 

Our brain functions on two very different modes. We are more familiar with focused mode. We know it as intense concentration to work through a problem step by step. It is a process where we travel along familiar and nicely paved road.

Diffuse mode is a relax thinking style where we make new neural connections. We look at things broadly from a very big picture perspective. 

When learning something new, we need to go back and forth between focused and diffuse modes to help deepen our knowledge.
